Running the code would not be an issue so long as it is in a pythonenvironment with the correct libaries installed(or using an online source such as Jupyter or Google Colab which should already have them).The libraries that would need to be on the system would include: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.metrics.For part 2, the libraries that we used are pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, sklearn, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.metrics. Buildingand running the code would follow the same steps as part 1. Because we are using SCIKITLEARN, the MSE result should be shift one decimal placeto the left to be the proper MSE percentage.
